This repository is for learning how to use github. 

So far I've created a branch, which made a copy of the master. The master branch holds the current release of whatever this project is. Branches are used to edit the latest version, which seems to be the main point of github--version control.

When you edit your derived branch and save your changes, you just created a commit. "On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why." (from the github tutorial)
